  - jekyll-feed

# Default permalink for posts - blog posts will be at /blog/:title.html
permalink: /blog/:title.html

# Jekyll will automatically find _posts in blog/_posts directory
# Posts will be accessible at /blog/:title.html

# Exclude build artifacts from Jekyll processing
# 
# IMPORTANT: index.html is intentionally NOT excluded because:
# 1. It has NO front matter (no YAML --- blocks)
# 2. Jekyll copies files without front matter AS-IS to _site/
# 3. This preserves the static company website at root
#
# Blog files (blog/index.md, blog/_posts/*.md) HAVE front matter
# and will be processed by Jekyll using root _layouts/ and _includes/
